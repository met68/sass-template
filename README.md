# sass-template
A SASS CSS template based on Barebones V3 CSS by Steve Cochran,
which in turn is based on Skeleton CSS by Dave Gamache.

This template however allows for much greater granularity in
setting grid and typography options and includes CSS styling
for navigation, footers, flash messages etc.

The template includes default styling for 
"prefers-color-scheme: dark".
